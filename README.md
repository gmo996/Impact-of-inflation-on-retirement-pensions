# Impact-of-inflation-on-retirement-pensions
The present document aims to determine the impact of the inflation derived from the COVID-19 crisis on the retired beneficiaries of the ONP, focusing on how, how much, and where it primarily affected.
Historical data from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is examined to understand the situation prior to the pandemic. Subsequently, the variation of the CPI during and after the pandemic is analyzed, covering the period between 2020 and 2022. A projection based on historical data is used, and machine learning algorithms are employed to estimate with greater precision the inflation values generated by the economic crisis of COVID-19.
Once these values are established, the analysis delves deeper to determine which departments and segments of the ONP beneficiaries were most affected in terms of the purchasing power of their retirement payments. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of inflation on ONP pensioners, identifying geographic areas and specific groups that experienced greater economic challenges during the crisis.
